How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  What's great about agile is that there are several layers that can help to interpret the needs of customers and users. The project owner should have a solid and personal understanding from the stakeholders what the goals and target audiences are, and what sorts of approaches and presentations are needed to accomplish that. When they make the user stories, they do so from the perspective of the end user, and that gives the developers a good way to understand what their objectives should be.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  Programs should be developed incrementally, because of agile and Object Orient principles both. Each portion should be done thoroughly and be finished up with little to know bugs, as a shippable piece of code. Agile's focus on small teams and directed, complete development incrementally is great ot keep in mind with future program development. 
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Being a good team member in software development, I think, means being both reliable and proficient, as well as trusting and connected. It is vitally important that you can pull your own weight, and that your work can stand up to what's required of it. Each developer's work should be able to seamlessly fit together into a finished and polished product, but the team succeeds or fails as a whole. Therefore, while individual responsibility is important, I think it's also vital that you have a team that can come together to help with any issues, lags in production, or inadequacies one team member may face. It's important that the team can rely upon itself. Every so often, everyone struggles, or encounters unforseen problems, or finds something that they do not understand as they thought they might. As such, it's important that a team can come together and work together ot complete the project on time and budget.
